                <h2>100 years of collective design experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Riot Games has once again found itself at the center of controversy after claiming that "our champions are not overloaded." This statement comes despite a long history of community complaints about newer champions being packed with excessive mechanics. Players have pointed to examples like Akshan, who can revive teammates while swinging across terrain, or Viego, whose kit allows him to steal enemy champions' abilities and reset endlessly. Many are questioning how this aligns with Riot’s infamous "100 years of game design experience" meme, which has been used to mock the company whenever they release another champion with seemingly unnecessary complexity.

                    The community backlash has been swift, with players comparing newer, overloaded designs to the simplicity of older champions like Annie, Malphite, or Warwick. While some argue that modern champions need more depth to stay relevant in League's ever-evolving meta, others see it as a clear shift towards overly complex kits that create balance nightmares. Whether Riot genuinely believes in their statement or is simply trying to deflect criticism, one thing remains certain—players aren’t letting them off the hook anytime soon.
