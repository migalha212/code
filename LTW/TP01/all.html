                <h2>"Our champions are not overloaded"</h2>
                <p>
                    Riot Games recently claimed that "our champions are not overloaded," sparking backlash from the League of Legends community. Players mocked the statement, citing examples like Akshan and Viego as proof that modern champion kits are excessively complex, reviving the infamous "100 years of game design experience" meme. While some argue that intricate mechanics keep the game fresh, many believe Riot is prioritizing flashy designs over balance and counterplay.
